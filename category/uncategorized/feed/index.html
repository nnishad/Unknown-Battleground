				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The $750,000 finals of ESL Pro League Season 5 came to a close last weekend with G2 lifting their first big trophy on Sunday. Here is a quick recap and the winners and losers of the Dallas event.</p>
<p>Following the IEM format, the Pro League Finals started with a round-robin group stage consisting of two groups of six, with the winning teams skipping to semi-finals, while the second and the third-placed sides advanced to the quarter-finals.</p>
<p>Group stage</p>
<p>In Group A, four teams ended up with a 3-2 record, with G2 grabbing first place due to head-to-head record (having defeated all of the other three teams with whom they were tied ). SK, EnVyUs, and fnatic played mr3 tiebreakers for the remaining two spots, and it was the Swedes who went out in fourth place after losing both of their matches.</p>
<p>Group B avoided the tiebreakers after North placed first with four wins, followed by mousesports, who only lost to the Danes, and Liquid, who snatched the third spot with a win over Mathias &#8220;MSL&#8221; Lauridsen&#8217;s team in the last round.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After beating Kinguin 16-8 on Train, BIG have secured their first win at the Europe Minor.</p>
<p>With a quad-kill from Johannes &#8220;tabseN&#8221; Wodarz in the pistol round, BIG started out their first match in Bucharest with a well-succeeded round as Terrorists. After winning the following two, and despite losing other two, the German squad easily got to an 8-2 lead.</p>
<p>Kinguin were then able to answer for three rounds, in which a triple-kill from Mikołaj &#8220;mouz&#8221; Karolewski and Grzegorz &#8220;SZPERO&#8221; Dziamałek in the 12th and 13th round, respectively, helped the Polish team close the gap at 5-8. Then, before the end of the first half, both squads traded rounds.</p>
<p>Despite winning the second pistol round, Bartosz &#8220;Hyper&#8221; Wolny and co. failed to secure the anti-eco. From that point, BIG won three more before facing Kinguin&#8217;s buy round, which Michał &#8220;MICHU&#8221; Müller almost pulled off with a 1v2 clutch.</p>
<p>As they kept breaking their adversaries&#8217; economy, BIG only lost one more round before finishing off Train with a 16-8 scoreline.</p>
