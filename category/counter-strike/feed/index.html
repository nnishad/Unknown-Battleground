				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We had a chat with Adil &#8220;ScreaM&#8221; Benrlitom following EnVyUs&#8217; quarter-finals finish at Pro League Finals about his and the team&#8217;s improvement after recent struggles, coach Damien &#8220;maLeK&#8221; Marcel, as well as the tiebreaking format.</p>
<p>The first two days saw EnVyUs placing second in Group A following three wins in the regular part of the group and successful tiebreakers, before the French-Belgian squad fell to Liquid in the quarter-finals on day three.</p>
<p>During the semi-finals day in Dallas, we got a hold of Adil &#8220;ScreaM&#8221; Benrlitom to find out more about how the team feels after their showing at the finals, his individual struggles at their previous offline tournaments, and the effect of coach Damien &#8220;maLeK&#8221; Marcel</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a brief stint on the bench, Shahzeb &#8220;ShahZaM&#8221; Khan will return to Misfits&#8217; active lineup, relegating Skyler &#8220;Relyks&#8221; Weaver to the backup position once again.</p>
<p>Misfits found themselves in a tough position going into the Americas Minor last week, as two of their starting players, Sean &#8220;seang@res&#8221; Gares and Shahzeb &#8220;ShahZaM&#8221; Khan didn&#8217;t attend the tournament.</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s in-game leader, seang@res, couldn&#8217;t be present at the event due to the fact that he was getting married, and has, as it was expected, already stepped back into the active roster.</p>
<p>However, just days before the Minor, the team ended up benching ShahZaM due to a dispute regarding a boot camp and preparation, with Luis &#8220;peacemaker&#8221; Tadeu shining some more light on the situation via a twitlonger, pointing out that the benching was not his own decision.</p>
<p>With the event around the corner, Misfits decided to use Caio &#8220;zqkS&#8221; Fonseca as their second stand-in at the event. The tournament didn&#8217;t end well for the team, as they went out with a 0-3 map record, losing to CLG and paiN.</p>
<p>Shortly after the disappointing event was brought to an end, Misfits announced that ShahZaM would be returning to the active lineup, together with seang@res. This means that Skyler &#8220;Relyks&#8221; Weaver will once again take a seat on the bench, while, according to the press release, zqkS will return to Brazil.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To get some insight into how fnatic are feeling going into DreamHack Open Summer, we got in touch with Jesper &#8220;JW&#8221; Wecksell, who also shared his thoughts on the state of the Swedish scene, fnatic&#8217;s performance in Dallas and various tournament rulesets.</p>
<p>Since reuniting their lineup that went on to win six straight tournaments at the end of 2015 and start of 2016, fnatic have only once made the playoffs of a tournament, at StarSeries S3 in Kiev. The team&#8217;s last tournament was the ESL Pro League Season 5 Finals, where they had a good start, but ended up going out in groups once again.</p>
<p>How the tournament in Dallas, Texas, influenced fnatic&#8217;s confidence, who are the most dangerous team in Jönköping, Sweden, and what lead to Denmark overtaking Sweden as the best CS nation are just some of the things Jesper &#8220;JW&#8221; Wecksell told us in our pre-DreamHack interview.</p>
