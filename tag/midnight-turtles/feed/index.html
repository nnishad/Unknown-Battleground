				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After beating Kinguin 16-8 on Train, BIG have secured their first win at the Europe Minor.</p>
<p>With a quad-kill from Johannes &#8220;tabseN&#8221; Wodarz in the pistol round, BIG started out their first match in Bucharest with a well-succeeded round as Terrorists. After winning the following two, and despite losing other two, the German squad easily got to an 8-2 lead.</p>
<p>Kinguin were then able to answer for three rounds, in which a triple-kill from Mikołaj &#8220;mouz&#8221; Karolewski and Grzegorz &#8220;SZPERO&#8221; Dziamałek in the 12th and 13th round, respectively, helped the Polish team close the gap at 5-8. Then, before the end of the first half, both squads traded rounds.</p>
<p>Despite winning the second pistol round, Bartosz &#8220;Hyper&#8221; Wolny and co. failed to secure the anti-eco. From that point, BIG won three more before facing Kinguin&#8217;s buy round, which Michał &#8220;MICHU&#8221; Müller almost pulled off with a 1v2 clutch.</p>
<p>As they kept breaking their adversaries&#8217; economy, BIG only lost one more round before finishing off Train with a 16-8 scoreline.</p>
