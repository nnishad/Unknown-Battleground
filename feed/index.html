				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a long pause due to technical issues, Renegades and Signature resumed their match and it was the Australian side that won in the end with a 2-1  map score (Mirage 9-16, Nuke 16-5, Overpass 16-11).</p>
<p>The deciding series of group A at the Asia Minor started with a shock, as Signature managed to sweep Renegades on Mirage with a 16-9 scoreline. Nuke, the Australian side&#8217;s pick, followed and we saw Aaron &#8220;AZR&#8221; Ward and co. replying with a strong showing of their own. Renegades took 11 rounds as Terrorists in the first half and swiftly secured the second map after switching to CT.</p>
<p>With the score tied at 1-1, the series went to the decider, Overpass. Just a few rounds into the series, extreme technical issues caused the match to be postponed for a couple of hours. After the problems were fixed, we saw Renegades kick into a higher gear and turn a tight 6-5 score into a respectable 9-6 CT half.</p>
<p>The start to the Terrorist side was good for the Australians, as they took the first three rounds, but Signature took control of the game from the first full buy onwards.</p>
<p>The team from Thailand got the score to 12-11, but the combination of Noah &#8220;Nifty&#8221; Francis, Nemanja &#8220;nexa&#8221; IsakoviÄ‡ and Justin &#8220;jks&#8221; Savage activated towards the end of the map and got Renegades the four following rounds that secured them the map and a spot in the playoffs.</p>

<p>The first two days saw EnVyUs placing second in Group A following three wins in the regular part of the group and successful tiebreakers, before the French-Belgian squad fell to Liquid in the quarter-finals on day three.</p>
<p>During the semi-finals day in Dallas, we got a hold of Adil &#8220;ScreaM&#8221; Benrlitom to find out more about how the team feels after their showing at the finals, his individual struggles at their previous offline tournaments, and the effect of coach Damien &#8220;maLeK&#8221; Marcel</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The $750,000 finals of ESL Pro League Season 5 came to a close last weekend with G2 lifting their first big trophy on Sunday. Here is a quick recap and the winners and losers of the Dallas event.</p>
<p>Following the IEM format, the Pro League Finals started with a round-robin group stage consisting of two groups of six, with the winning teams skipping to semi-finals, while the second and the third-placed sides advanced to the quarter-finals.</p>
<p>Group stage</p>
<p>In Group A, four teams ended up with a 3-2 record, with G2 grabbing first place due to head-to-head record (having defeated all of the other three teams with whom they were tied ). SK, EnVyUs, and fnatic played mr3 tiebreakers for the remaining two spots, and it was the Swedes who went out in fourth place after losing both of their matches.</p>
<p>Group B avoided the tiebreakers after North placed first with four wins, followed by mousesports, who only lost to the Danes, and Liquid, who snatched the third spot with a win over Mathias &#8220;MSL&#8221; Lauridsen&#8217;s team in the last round.</p>

<p>Misfits found themselves in a tough position going into the Americas Minor last week, as two of their starting players, Sean &#8220;seang@res&#8221; Gares and Shahzeb &#8220;ShahZaM&#8221; Khan didn&#8217;t attend the tournament.</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s in-game leader, seang@res, couldn&#8217;t be present at the event due to the fact that he was getting married, and has, as it was expected, already stepped back into the active roster.</p>
<p>However, just days before the Minor, the team ended up benching ShahZaM due to a dispute regarding a boot camp and preparation, with Luis &#8220;peacemaker&#8221; Tadeu shining some more light on the situation via a twitlonger, pointing out that the benching was not his own decision.</p>
<p>With the event around the corner, Misfits decided to use Caio &#8220;zqkS&#8221; Fonseca as their second stand-in at the event. The tournament didn&#8217;t end well for the team, as they went out with a 0-3 map record, losing to CLG and paiN.</p>
<p>Shortly after the disappointing event was brought to an end, Misfits announced that ShahZaM would be returning to the active lineup, together with seang@res. This means that Skyler &#8220;Relyks&#8221; Weaver will once again take a seat on the bench, while, according to the press release, zqkS will return to Brazil.</p>

<p>Robin &#8220;robiin&#8221; SjÃ¶gren &#038; company qualified for GeForce Cup 2017 using the name Fightclub but attended the LAN event under Gatekeepers&#8217; banner. In WrocÅ‚aw, Poland, Gatekeepers were able to upset PENTA with a 2-0 victory in the quarter-finals.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration their recent results, Gatekeepers signed the squad on a permanent basis with their sponsor loot.bet. robiin said in his statement that the team meshed together and decided to maintain the lineup:<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To get some insight into how fnatic are feeling going into DreamHack Open Summer, we got in touch with Jesper &#8220;JW&#8221; Wecksell, who also shared his thoughts on the state of the Swedish scene, fnatic&#8217;s performance in Dallas and various tournament rulesets.</p>
<p>Since reuniting their lineup that went on to win six straight tournaments at the end of 2015 and start of 2016, fnatic have only once made the playoffs of a tournament, at StarSeries S3 in Kiev. The team&#8217;s last tournament was the ESL Pro League Season 5 Finals, where they had a good start, but ended up going out in groups once again.</p>
<p>How the tournament in Dallas, Texas, influenced fnatic&#8217;s confidence, who are the most dangerous team in JÃ¶nkÃ¶ping, Sweden, and what lead to Denmark overtaking Sweden as the best CS nation are just some of the things Jesper &#8220;JW&#8221; Wecksell told us in our pre-DreamHack interview.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After beating Kinguin 16-8 on Train, BIG have secured their first win at the Europe Minor.</p>
<p>With a quad-kill from Johannes &#8220;tabseN&#8221; Wodarz in the pistol round, BIG started out their first match in Bucharest with a well-succeeded round as Terrorists. After winning the following two, and despite losing other two, the German squad easily got to an 8-2 lead.</p>
<p>Kinguin were then able to answer for three rounds, in which a triple-kill from MikoÅ‚aj &#8220;mouz&#8221; Karolewski and Grzegorz &#8220;SZPERO&#8221; DziamaÅ‚ek in the 12th and 13th round, respectively, helped the Polish team close the gap at 5-8. Then, before the end of the first half, both squads traded rounds.</p>
<p>Despite winning the second pistol round, Bartosz &#8220;Hyper&#8221; Wolny and co. failed to secure the anti-eco. From that point, BIG won three more before facing Kinguin&#8217;s buy round, which MichaÅ‚ &#8220;MICHU&#8221; MÃ¼ller almost pulled off with a 1v2 clutch.</p>
<p>As they kept breaking their adversaries&#8217; economy, BIG only lost one more round before finishing off Train with a 16-8 scoreline.</p>
