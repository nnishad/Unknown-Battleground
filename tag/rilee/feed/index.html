				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a brief stint on the bench, Shahzeb &#8220;ShahZaM&#8221; Khan will return to Misfits&#8217; active lineup, relegating Skyler &#8220;Relyks&#8221; Weaver to the backup position once again.</p>
<p>Misfits found themselves in a tough position going into the Americas Minor last week, as two of their starting players, Sean &#8220;seang@res&#8221; Gares and Shahzeb &#8220;ShahZaM&#8221; Khan didn&#8217;t attend the tournament.</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s in-game leader, seang@res, couldn&#8217;t be present at the event due to the fact that he was getting married, and has, as it was expected, already stepped back into the active roster.</p>
<p>However, just days before the Minor, the team ended up benching ShahZaM due to a dispute regarding a boot camp and preparation, with Luis &#8220;peacemaker&#8221; Tadeu shining some more light on the situation via a twitlonger, pointing out that the benching was not his own decision.</p>
<p>With the event around the corner, Misfits decided to use Caio &#8220;zqkS&#8221; Fonseca as their second stand-in at the event. The tournament didn&#8217;t end well for the team, as they went out with a 0-3 map record, losing to CLG and paiN.</p>
<p>Shortly after the disappointing event was brought to an end, Misfits announced that ShahZaM would be returning to the active lineup, together with seang@res. This means that Skyler &#8220;Relyks&#8221; Weaver will once again take a seat on the bench, while, according to the press release, zqkS will return to Brazil.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gatekeepers have announced that they have signed their Swedish roster on a permanent basis after the squad represented them at GeForce Cup 2017.</p>
<p>Robin &#8220;robiin&#8221; Sjögren &#038; company qualified for GeForce Cup 2017 using the name Fightclub but attended the LAN event under Gatekeepers&#8217; banner. In Wrocław, Poland, Gatekeepers were able to upset PENTA with a 2-0 victory in the quarter-finals.</p>
<p>They then faced Space Soldiers who beat the Swedes 2-0 and went on to win the tournament. Gatekeepers earned $4,000 at the event. Also, they have recently won Yoggi Yalla Cup 2017—a Swedish online tournament—and earned ~$2,850.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration their recent results, Gatekeepers signed the squad on a permanent basis with their sponsor loot.bet. robiin said in his statement that the team meshed together and decided to maintain the lineup:<br />
You can catch Gatekeepers in action on June 22 when they face MAXISAUCISSE in Hellcase Cup 5.</p>
